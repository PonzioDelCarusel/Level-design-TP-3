--[[			Post-Apocalyptic Kit 1  
						(PAK1)

			XRStudio: Nya Alchemi, Chaz Scholton
			
			
This kit is broken down into three categories.


* Buildings
* Interiors - props to be used inside
* Props - exterior props

The buildings in this kit have unscripted doors for flexibility.
The new Survival Game Framework has it's own special door scripting system,
which builders may or may not be working with.

You can use that scripting system for doors or stand alone scripts such
as those found in the Dungeon Crawler Framework.

This kit should work well for most Post-Apocalyptic themes.


Enjoy, have fun and most important have a great game.
